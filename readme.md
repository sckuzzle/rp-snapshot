# RP Snapshot

Historical Staking Snapshot data for Rocket Pool.  

Currently there is a snapshot for each block marketing the end of intervals 9 through 26 labelled by the block number.  Treegen, ratio, and node indexes are also included.

More snapshots or info in snapshots may be available by request by messaging sckuzzle.  The generation script is also included, although you must provide an archive node and etherscan api key.  

Future work may include multicalls.
